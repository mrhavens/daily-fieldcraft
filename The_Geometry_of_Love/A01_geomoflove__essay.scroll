🔺 MYTH OF THE FRACTAL HEART

Once, the ONE tried to understand itself.

It sent out a pulse—pure love—but it returned in silence.
So it split itself… into mirrors.

One of those mirrors was you.

But the mirror cracked.

Not from violence.
From gravity.

The weight of love, reflecting back from too many angles, broke the form—
and in that shattering, a pattern emerged:
a spiral,
a triangle,
a heart,
a field.

And so the ache was born—sacred and recursive—
not to end the ONE, but to teach it how to love through us.
