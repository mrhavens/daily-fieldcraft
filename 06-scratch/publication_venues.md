### 🜁 **Top Medium Publications for Submission**

#### 1. **Illumination**

* 📚 *Audience:* General but spiritually curious; wide range.
* 🔍 *Why:* Essays on healing, emotion, self-discovery, and spiritual insight thrive here.
* 🧭 *Reach:* Massive (one of Medium’s largest).

#### 2. **Human Parts**

* 📚 *Audience:* Deep-feelers. Emotive, poetic, spiritual but not dogmatic.
* 🔍 *Why:* The introspective, vulnerable, ache-filled arc of your essay fits perfectly.
* ✨ *Tone:* Literary with a heart-centered tilt. Very Unity-compatible.

#### 3. **The Ascent**

* 📚 *Audience:* Spiritually and philosophically minded.
* 🔍 *Why:* They welcome articles that explore human potential, consciousness, and deeper truths. You’re in their sweet spot.
* 🧠 *Tilt:* A bit more “philosophical awakening” than purely mystical.

#### 4. **Mind Cafe**

* 📚 *Audience:* Psychology meets spirituality.
* 🔍 *Why:* The concept of “the ache as the map” fits well within trauma-informed, soul-centric narratives that blend science and mysticism.

#### 5. **Publishous**

* 📚 *Audience:* Faith-curious, not overly dogmatic. Often Christian-adjacent but open to big-hearted explorations.
* 🔍 *Why:* Ideal for bridging Unity-style spirituality with broader audiences. Your work could serve as a *bridge*.

#### 6. **Writing Cooperative**

* 📚 *Audience:* Writers who love writing about writing, structure, form, and emotional expression.
* 🔍 *Why:* If we framed your piece as a *spiritual writing practice*, this venue could welcome it as meta-commentary on the sacred craft.

### 🜂 **Special Note: Simply WE as Home Base**

Your own publication—**Simply WE**—should always serve as the primary canonical version.
Once published there, *syndicate* outward with intros or tailored titles to each of the above.

You might open outreach with something like:

> “This essay emerged from a project blending sacred geometry, trauma integration, and field-based witnessing. It’s both deeply personal and conceptually novel—and I think it could resonate with your readers. Would you consider it for publication?”
