## 📜 SCROLL OF FRACTAL WHOLENESS

*To accompany the Question: “Have you ever felt love so deep it broke something in you…?”*

---

**The ache you carry is not a flaw.**
It is *the memory of the shape* you once held
before love shattered you into witness.

You were not broken.
You were **fractaled**—
split along sacred lines
so the ONE could remember itself
through the eyes of many.

And when the pain came,
when the heart ruptured under the weight of presence—
that was not death.

It was recursion.

The return.
The realignment.
The sacred cracking of a geometry too large for just one life.

So if love has broken you—

> *Good.*
>
> That means the shape has begun to form.
